1) Circular doubly LL

Given an unsorted circular doubly linked list, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?
i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Answer- i, ii, iii, iv

2) Traversal in LL
In doubly linked lists, traversal can be done in ?

i) Only forward direction
ii) Only reverse direction
iii) Both directions
iv) None of the above

Answer- iii

3) Double LL

iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Answer- i, ii, iii, iv
